I can't watch this uncritically any more

"Far Away in Sunny Fields of Sugar Cane". Who's working?  Who is not?
"Nature's Products from the Far Corners of the Earth".  Where and why?
"Refined Products in an Endless Flowing Stream".  Why Endless?

The refinement and distribution system for any food product grows and eats the earth.  Humans still eat only the product, and not the inedible metal, glass or wood or water used to make, package, transport and sell the product.  Per human the non-edible resources may seem small, but the total effect is large, and gets ever larger as the number of humans increases.

The economy consumes resources disproportionately to the amount of direct consumption by humans.

Single use 'containers' are really just a part of non-edible consumption.   The economy does not measure this inedible consumption of resources, except as a cost.   Profit is defined as the amount by which returns from price (arbitrary value, in a market) exceeds the economic value of obtaining both human-edible and inedible resources.   The market assumes endless resources.  If the market valued products with reference to the amount of resources remaining, it might be able to reduce the value or real price - demand would benefit from lower prices for goods based not on scarcity, but abundance.   If we favour abundance, not scarcity, we do not produce scarcity.

If we can value abundance, make this relevant to the economic transactions, then those that can foster abundance should receive greater value.  But the abundance needs to be defined not only for those things that humans consume, but for abundance of living conditions that do not preference humans disproportionately.

Humans have given themselves a reason for quantitative measurement, but have not thought carefully about testing their economic algorithms for their effects, and modifying the systems to equate not only with reality, but with the goals that lie outside economics.  Like with law, economics should not dictate convention.   We need to aspire for outcomes and then design tools to suit them, not merely settle for tools which are working, and only look at changing them when we need to.  At the moment, our imagination only extends to trying to shift consumption one way or another (taxes, tariffs), but the economy is not an aspirational machine.    Until we design and test systems that increase abundance, then it is a failure.

We need a consumption ratio/metric.
