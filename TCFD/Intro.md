Climate Change Risk Litigation and Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures
(c) Craig Duncan 2020

The ramifications of climate-related risk has now become part of the legal regulation of financial risks and disclosures and part of the business regulation norms.  This is a brief history of the framework and its development. 

In 2013 ASIC originally released Regulatory Guideline 247 (RG247), which amongst other things dealt with the annual reporting requirements of corporations under s292(1) of the Corporations Act.  This would become one of the main regulatory documents relied on by ASIC for integrating these standards into conventional regulatory frameworks.

Further regulatory attention was promoted by the COP21 Climate Change Conference, in Paris.  

In 2015, the G20 Financial Stability board undertook its own investigations then established the Task Force on Climate Related Disclosures.  This was led by Michael Bloomberg (NY).   

The framework proposed in these recommendations was a voluntary scheme of disclosures for climate-related risk (Ref15).  The emphasis was on businesses integrating risks into ordinary business planning.

Australian legal consideration of the subject of directors' liabilities under s180 of the Corporations Act was assisted by the release of an opinion on that topic by Noel Hutley SC and Sebastian Hartford Davies in October 2016.   The purpose of that opinion was to consider the extent to which the duty of care and diligence imposed upon company directors by s 180(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 may (or must) take into account climate change risks.  The permissive question reflects the uncertainty in the law at that time.   

The Paris Agreement was ratified by Australia on 10 November 2016 and entered into force in Australia the next month (9 December 2016).  The effect of this was for Australia to agree to reduce its greenhouse emissions to below 2005 levels by 2030.

The Final TCFD Recommendations Report was published in 2017 (Ref 14). {article link}

In November 2017, Professor Jacqueline Peel from Melbourne Law School, presented on liability for misleading and deceptive conduct for climate risk (Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIAamMAdxM).  Her general interest was in general legal mechanisms as a way of driving behavioural change by companies.  This presentation refers to the general division of business risks from climate change into physical and transitional (legal and policy risks, litigation and technology risks included).  She also referred to the Senate enquiry that had been undertaken, and APRA's lead in saying that corporations should be thinking about climate risk (Ref9).

In October 2018, the IPCC issued its report to deal with the ramifications of an increase in global warming of 1.5C (from pre-industrial levels), associated with regional changes identified in that report.  These ramifications were concerned with the effect on human society, including health, food and water security, and economic issues.  The report also dealt with ways in which there might be transition to a state in which global warming could be limited, or arrested in the future.

In 2018, the regulatory regime in Australia was updated explicitly to refer to climate change risks, in ASIC's RG247.   RG247 applies to listed entities, who must prepare directors' reports annually under s292(1) Corporations Act.   The contents of those reports are prescribed under s299A(1), and it must include information that would be reasonable required by shareholders to make informed assessments of matters associated with the company's operation, financial position and prospects. 

Near the end of 2018, professional accounting bodies like AASB also introduced guidance statements for voluntary financial accounting estimates related to climate change risk.  

Shortly afterwards, in early 2019, there were a range of institional statements and changes (including from APRA) that accepted the potential economic impacts of climate change could affect the whole economy.  In Australia, this included requirements for mandatory financial reporting in line with TCFD recommendations, as part of prudential financial regulation.   Also, in  March 2019, Noel Hutley SC, and Sebastian Hartford Davies published their supplementary opinion regarding directors' duties in relation to climate risks (Ref13) that described the recent trend toward awareness of the risk, and the additional scientific evidence for, changes to the climate in coming years.  They considered that these risks were now 'well documented'.  In particular, they suggested that the effect on business of having to take into account 'decarbonisation' activities (i.e. a transition to a low-carbon economy) had to be taken into account.  They identified particular industries as being the minimum industries affected: banking, insurance, asset ownership/management, energy, transport, material/buildings, agriculture, food and forest product industries.

Some recent articles are creating a separate category for the 'litigation' risk, in addition to the physical and transitory risk categories (Ref8).

In August 2019 there was an update to RG247 (clause RG247.66) to make it explicit that 'climate change is a systemic risk' that could have a material impact on these things.  The guidelines suggest that it would be misleading not to consider climate risk amongst those future business risks.  Also, RG247 now expressly refers to the ability of corporations to take into account sustainability reporting or the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD); thereby incorporating international developments into local reporting requirements.  The TCFD has directed some attention, amongst other things, to risks that include the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Potential actions will include liability for misleading climate risk disclosure.  The primary targets of these actions to date have been energy companies and banks.  One such case, Abrahams v Commonwealth Bank of Australia, was commenced in 2017 (Ref10, Ref11).  As was reported when that case commenced:   

	"As the G20’s Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures recently reported, climate risks can be physical (for instance, when extreme weather events affect property or business operations) or transition risks (the effect of new laws and policies designed to mitigate climate change, or market changes as economies transition to renewable and low-emission technology).

	For example, restrictions on coal mining may result in these assets being “stranded,” meaning they become liabilities rather than assets on company balance sheets. Similarly, the rise of renewable energy may reduce the life span, and consequently the value, of conventional power generation assets.

	Companies who rely on the exploitation of fossil fuels face increasing transition risks. So too do the banks that lend money to, and invest in, these projects. It is these types of risks that are at issue in the case against CBA." (Ref1)

However, the case was withdrawn within the same year, after the CBA released its annual report only a week after the claim was filed in the Federal Court, evidencing it had included some level of climate risk reporting (Ref2).  The incidence of TCFD-related disclosures will be able to be gathered by an analysis of financial reports, at least for listed companies.  

Another more recent case, commenced in July 2018, is McVeigh v Retail Employees Superannuation Trust(Ref3), in which breaches of superannuation legislation, rather than the Corporations Act, are being considered as a result of alleged failing to disclose information on climate business risks.

[July 2019 guidance by Martjin Wilder of Baker McKenzie](Ref6).  It is now considered important that as part of the TCFD framework, a scenario analysis should be performed(Ref6,Ref7), as well as including climate risk in risk registers and management reports.

A recent and useful paper on the effect of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change litigation was presented by Preston CJ (Chief Justice of the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales) at the Dundee Climate Conference held in September 2019 (Ref4).  Covering a wide range of international discussion and judicial decisions, the paper also includes a consideration of the importance of the Australian Gloucester Resources Ltd v Minister for Planning decision (Ref5) (as well as the Urgenda decision, that considered duty of care in relatoin to climate change (Ref12)).
